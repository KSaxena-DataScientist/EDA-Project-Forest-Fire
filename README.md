# EDA-Project-Forest-Fire
I used a dataset on Algerian Forest Fires from UCI. The dataset contains a culmination of forest fire observations and data in two regions of Algeria: the Bejaia region and the Sidi Bel-Abbes region. The timeline of this dataset is from June 2012 to September 2012. In this project, we focused on whether certain weather features could predict forest fires in these regions using few Classification algorithms.
